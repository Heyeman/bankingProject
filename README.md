                              Banking Management System

The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank.

1-admin can: creat staff and user accounts,  activate those accounts and  delete accounts
2-staff can: add amount in account deduct amount from account request to open account and withdrawal 
3-customer(user)  can : perform transaction

Bank Management System is based on a concept of recording customer’s account details. the best way we can do this through DBMS.Database management systems are specifically designed for the storage and retrieval of (large amounts of) data.  Banks handle large amounts of data. A DBMS enables us to store that data, operate on it, and retrieve it when needed, fast enough for us and our customer’s needs.
The system automates basic banking functions to aid a bank clerk’s day-to-day operations. Additionally, the system’s purpose is to allow for the storage of information for a large number of client accounts, as well as the ability to add, retrieve, and edit information for any account.

That’s not the full story. Most banks use a DBMS type called “relational” (RDBMS for short), for good reasons. These reasons are abbreviated ACID, for the four properties that every RDBMS places above all else:


     In order to run the project, we recomeand you to install visual studio 2022 and MySQL Connector/C++ 8.0 to communicate with MySQL servers.
